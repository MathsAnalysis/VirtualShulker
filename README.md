# VirtualShulker

VirtualShulker is a Java-based project providing innovative features for virtual shulker boxes, designed for integration into Minecraft plugins or any environment requiring advanced virtual inventory management.

## Main Features

- **Virtual Shulker Box management:** create, open, and manipulate shulker boxes directly in the virtual world, without needing physical items in-game.
- **Intuitive interface:** easy to integrate and use via simple interactions.
- **Advanced customization:** configure behaviors and permissions for virtual contents.
- **Fully Java compatible:** developed entirely in Java for maximum compatibility with Minecraft servers.

## Installation

> **Note:** To use VirtualShulker, you need a working Java environment and (optionally) a compatible Minecraft server (Bukkit/Spigot/Paper).

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MathsAnalysis/VirtualShulker.git
   ```
2. Build the project using Maven or Gradle.
3. Place the generated `.jar` file in your Minecraft server's plugins folder.
4. Restart the server to enable VirtualShulker.

## Usage

After setup, VirtualShulker allows players to access a virtual shulker box via specific plugin commands or custom graphical interfaces. Configuration and documentation for commands can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/MathsAnalysis/VirtualShulker/wiki) (if available) or directly in the source code.
